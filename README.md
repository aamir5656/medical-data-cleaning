# Medical Dataset - Data Cleaning & Analysis

This project involves working with a real-world medical dataset. The primary focus is on cleaning and preparing the data for future analysis and modeling using Python and Pandas.

## 🔍 Work Done in this Project

- ✅ Handled inconsistent text entries by converting small alphabet characters to proper uppercase format where necessary.
- ✅ Fixed incomplete or incorrectly written entries (e.g., replacing wrong or partial values like "Ysh" with correct forms such as "Yas").
- ✅ Checked the dataset for potential overfitting issues in preparation for machine learning use.
- ✅ Filled missing or null values in float-type columns to ensure data completeness.
- ✅ Used Pandas for all the data manipulation, including filtering, replacing, and transforming columns.

## 📂 Files Included

- `realworld_medical_dirty.csv` – Original uncleaned dataset
